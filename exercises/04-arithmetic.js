How much money do I have if at the start of the day I had $94.
I spent $4.25 on coffee. A friend gave me $7 that he owed me. 
I went out for a meal. The bill was $23.50, but I also gave a 20% tip.
Some friends and I found $20 on the ground and split it four ways.

hint: your answer should total 73.55

/**
 * Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.
  1. Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.
  2. Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.
  3. Multiply the results from the last two steps together, storing the result in a variable called finalResult. The product should be 48. If it isn't, you'll have to adjust some of the initial input values.
  4. Finally, write another function that checks whether finalResult is an even number. Store the result in a variable called evenOddCheck.
